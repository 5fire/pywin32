<H2>History of Scintilla and SciTE</H2>
<H3>Release 1.0</H3>
	<P>Released on 17 May 1999. </P>
	<P>Changed name of "Tide" to "SciTE" to avoid clash with a TCL based 
	IDE. "SciTE" is a SCIntilla based Text Editor and is Latin meaning 
	something like "understanding in a neat way" and is also an Old 
	English version of the word "shit".</P>
	<P>There is a SCI_AUTOCSTOPS message for defining a string of characters 
	that will stop autocompletion mode. Autocompletion mode is cancelled when 
	any cursor movement occurs apart from backspace.</P>
	<P>GTK+ version now splits horizontally as well as vertically and all dialogs
	cancel when the escape key is pressed.
	</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.93</H3>
	<P>Released on 12 May 1999. </P>
	<P>A bit more robust than 0.92 and supports SCI_MARKERNEXT 
	message.
	</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.92</H3>
	<P>Released on 11 May 1999. </P>
	<P>GTK+ version now contains all features of Windows version 
	with some very small differences. Executing programs works much better now.</P>
	<P>New palette code to allow more colours to be displayed in 256 colour
	screen modes. A line number column can be displayed to the left of the 
	selection margin.</P>
	<P>The code that maps from line numbers to text positions and back 
	has been completely rewritten to be faster, and to allow markers to move 
	with the text.</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.91</H3>
	<P>Released on 30 April 1999, containing fixes to text measuring to make Scintilla work
	better with bitmap fonts. Also some small fixes to make compiling work with Visual C++.
	</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.90</H3>
	<P>Released on 29 April 1999, containing working GTK+/Linux version.
	</P>
	<P>The Java, C++ and Python lexers recognise operators as distinct from
	default allowing them to be highlighted.
	</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.82</H3>
	<P>Released on 1 April 1999, to fix a problem with handling the Enter key in PythonWin.
	Also fixes some problems with cmd key mapping.
	</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.81</H3>
	<P>Released on 30th March 1999, containing bug fixes and a few more features.</P>
	<P>Static linking supported and Tidy.EXE, a statically linked version of Tide.EXE. 
	Changes to compiler flags in the makefiles to optimise for size.</P>
	<P>Scintilla supports a 'savepoint' in the undo stack which can be set by the 
	container when the document is saved. 
	Notifications are sent to the container when the savepoint is entered or left, allowing 
	the container to to display a dirty indicator and change its menues.</P>
	<P>When Scintilla is set to read-only mode, a notification is sent to the
	container should the user try to edit the document. This can be used to check the 
	document out of a version control system.</P>
	<P>There is an API for setting the appearence of indicators.</P>
	<P>The keyboard mapping can be redefined or removed so it can be 
	implemented completely by the container. All of the keyboard commands are now 
	commands which can be sent by the container.</P>
	<P>A home command like Visual C++ with one hit going to the start of the text on the 
	line and the next going to the left margin is available. I do not personally like this
	but my fingers have become trained to it by much repetition.</P>
	<P>SCI_MARKERDELETEALL has an argument in wParam which is the number of the type
	marker to delete with -1 performing the old action of removing all marker types.</P>
	<P>Tide now understands both the file name and line numbers in error messages in 
	most cases.</P>
	<P>Tide remembers the current lines of files in the recently used list.</P>
	<P>Tide has a Find in Files command.</P>
<H3>Beta release 0.80</H3>
	<P>This was the first public release on 14th March 1999, containing a mostly working Win32 
	Scintilla DLL and Tide EXE.</P>
<H3>Beta releases of SciTE were called Tide</H3>
