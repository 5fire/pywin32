		Scintilla and SciTE are no longer beta - this means that I think
		they are fairly stable and are unlikely to crash under normal
		use. There will certainly still be bugs in there so watch out for them 
		and please send me mail if you see one.<BR>
		I am going on an overseas holiday until mid September and will 
		not have an opportunity to do much coding work on this project
		while away. 
		I'll still be reading my email whenever possible, although less 
		frequently, possibly once a week depending on where 'net access
		can be found.<BR>
		The name of the editor application has changed from "Tide" to 
		"SciTE" to avoid confusion with a TCL based IDE.

	<A href="ScintillaDoc.html">Scintilla</A> is a free source code editing component. 
	As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes 
	features especially useful when editing and debugging source code.
	These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and
	call tips. 
	The selection margin can contain markers like those used 
	in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line.
	Styling choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of 
	proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background
	colours and multiple fonts.<BR>
	It comes with complete source code and may be used in any free project or 
	commercial product.

	<A href="SciTEDoc.html">SciTE</A> is a SCIntilla based Text Editor.
	Originally built to demonstrate Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful 
	editor with facilities for building and running programs. 
	It is best used for jobs with simple configurations - I use it for building test and
	demonstration programs as well as SciTE and Scintilla, themselves.

	Development of Scintilla started as an effort to improve the text 
	editor in PythonWin. After being frustrated by problems in the Richedit 
	control used by PythonWin, it looked like the best way forward was to 
	write a new edit control.
	The biggest problem with Richedit and other similar controls is that they treat
	styling changes as important persistent changes to the document so they are 
	saved into the undo stack and set the document's dirty flag. For source code, 
	styling should not be persisted as it can be mechanically recreated. <BR>
	<A href="http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/">PythonWin builds 124 
	and 125</A> include copies of Scintilla. <BR>
	In general, the best strategy to use with combining Scintilla and PythonWin 
	is to use the version of Scintilla included with PythonWin as newer versions
	may not be compatible.<BR>
	Scintilla 1.0 is not compatible with PythonWin 125, but should be 
	compatible with PythonWin 126.
</P>
<P>
	Scintilla and SciTE are currently available for Intel Win32 and Linux with GTK+.
	They have been run on Windows 95, NT, and Red Hat Linux 4.2 with GTK+ 1.2.0.
