<H2>Download.</H2>
<P>
	The <A href="License.txt">license</A> for using Scintilla is 
	similar to that of Python containing very few restrictions.
</P>
<H3>Release 1.0</H3>
<P>
	You can <A href="SciTE100.zip">download a ZIP file (190K)</A> 
	containing the C++ source code and executables for Scintilla and SciTE. 
	While a release version, it is likely that there are still bugs in the code
	that could lead to loss of data. Please make sure you save often and back
	up your source code.<BR>
	After downloading the file, unzip it, and run SciTE.EXE. The files required to run 
	SciTE are SciTE.EXE, Scintilla.DLL, and 
	SciTEGlobal.properties
	and these are best located in one directory on the path. 
	To see a demonstration of some more of Scintilla's features open the
	demo.pyro file which changes SciTE into demonstration mode.
</P>
	There is a <A href="SciTE.tgz">GTK+/Linux</A> version. 
	In the Linux tradition, this download only contains source code 
	and it is exactly the same source code as in the Windows version.
	To build it, you will have to have a c++ compiler 
	(I use gcc 2.8, but egcs should do just as well) and GTK+ 1.2.0 installed.<BR>
	The Makefile_gtk file is used to build SciTE, it can be invoked as:<BR>
	make -f Makefile_gtk<BR>
	The SciTEGTK.properties file is better than the SciTEGlobal.properties for use 
	on Linux/GTK+ as it specifies fonts that are likely to be installed. Under Linux, 
	SciTE reads its SciTEGlobal.properties file from the user's home directory.
<P>
	A <A href="Tide.zip">previous release, 0.82</A>, can also be downloaded.
