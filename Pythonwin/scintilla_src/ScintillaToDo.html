<H2>Bugs and To Do List</H2>
<H3>Scintilla Bugs</H3>
	<P>Drag and Drop does not work</P>
	<P>At the end of italics style runs characters can be chopped off. 
	An example is using Verdana 12 point italics for strings makes
	an ending double quote half visible and an ending single quote invisible.
	This is hard to solve completely, may be better to avoid these situations
	by, for example, choosing a font like Times New Roman for strings.</P>
	<P>Dragging over bold text in some fonts will ripple because of the 
	difference in size between drawing all of a string at once and drawing it in 
	parts.</P>
	
<H3>SciTE Bugs</H3>
	<P>When a file is opened by the user typing the filename, the case 
	of the name on disk is not checked. This can lead to files being saved
	with wrong capitalisation which upsets Java.</P>
	<P>File pattern expressions in the properties file only seem to work for
	the *.extension form - for example, makefiles are not displayed correctly.</P>
	<P>There has been a report of SciTE exiting as soon as the mouse is 
	moved over it when launched Start | Run. I have not yet reproduced this.
	</P>

<H3>GTK+ Version Bugs</H3>
	<P>The caret does not blink. This is considered an asset by some. A future version
	will allow blinking or nonblinking carets with a choice of caret colour 
	on both GTK+ and Windows.</P>

<H3>Scintilla To Do</H3>
	<P>Columnar selection.</P>
	<P>Printing support.</P>
	<P>Simple pattern based styling.</P>
	<P>Regular expressions in find functions.</P>
	<P>Performance.</P>
	<P>Line wrapping.</P>
	<P>Different height lines based upon tallest text on the line rather than on
	the tallest style possible.</P>
<H3>SciTE To Do</H3>
	<P>Printing support.</P>
	<P>HTML styling. Even better would be styling that understands embedded
	scripts and styles them properly.</P>
	<P>Remember last chosen items as defaults such as the file type in the 
	open file dialog.</P>
	<P>Support simple auto-completion / call tips.</P>
	<P>Should check if current file has meen modified by another process and reload it. </P>
	<P>Allow adding new items to tools menu.</P>

<H3>Directions</H3>
<P>
	The main point of this development is Scintilla, and this is where most effort 
	will go. SciTE will get new features, but only when they make my life easier - I am not
	intending to make it grow up to be a huge full-function IDE like Visual Cafe.
</P>
<P>
	For GTK+ support, much new code has been added with many #ifdef statements 
	to choose between Windows and GTK+. This is ugly, and will be replaced wherever
	easy with the platform portability classes specified in Platform.h and 
	implemented in either PlatWin.cc and PlatGTK.cc depending on the platform.
</P>
<P>
	If you are interested in contributing code, do not feel any need to make it cross 
	platform. Just code it for your platform and I'll either reimplement for the other 
	platform or ensure that there is no effect on the other platform.
